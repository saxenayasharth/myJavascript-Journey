1. What is the difference between null and undefined?
Null in JavaScript means an empty value and is also a primitive type in JavaScript. The variable which has been assigned as null contains no value. Undefined, on the other hand, means the variable has been declared, but its value has not been assigned.

2. What is the difference between == and ===?
The == operator performs a loose equality comparison that performs type coercion if necessary to make the comparison possible. The === operator, on the other hand, performs a strict equality comparison that does not perform type coercion and requires the operands to have the 
same type.

3. What is type coercion in JavaScript?
Type coercion is the process of converting a value from one data type to another. In JavaScript, type coercion happens implicitly when operators or functions are applied to values of different types.

4. What is the event loop in JavaScript?
Event Loop keeps running continuously and checks the Main stack, if it has any frames to execute, if not then it checks Callback queue, if Callback queue has codes to execute then it pops the message from it to the Main Stack for the execution.

5. What is the difference between let, const, and var?
The main difference between "var", "let", and "const" is in their scope and assignability. Variables declared with "var" have the function-level scope and can be reassigned, while "let" and "const" variables have the block-level scope and "let" can be reassigned, but "const" cannot.

6. Explain the concept of callback functions.
Any function that is passed as an argument to another function so that it can be executed in that other function is called as a callback function
